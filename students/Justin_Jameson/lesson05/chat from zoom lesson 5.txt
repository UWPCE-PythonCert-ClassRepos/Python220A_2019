From Kyle Creek to Everyone:  06:02 PM
I am ready whenever
From danielcastro to Everyone:  06:02 PM
yes ready
From PYTHON Host to Everyone:  06:04 PM
Any volunteer to answer the question :)
From Sam Chang to Everyone:  06:18 PM
not yet
From Me to Everyone:  06:18 PM
yes
From Kyle Creek to Everyone:  06:18 PM
I tried to install the software. Not sure if it works
From Aaron Devey to Everyone:  06:19 PM
haven't tried yet
From Kyle Creek to Everyone:  06:20 PM
I had to go to the mongo website to install Mongo
From danielcastro to Everyone:  06:20 PM
theres a test file you can run to make sure everything was installed
From Aaron Devey to Everyone:  06:20 PM
brew is for mac
https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/  <--- windows instructions
From Kyle Creek to Everyone:  06:21 PM
I have a question about Mongo, or maybe API's in general. From what I"ve gathered Mongo is an API. I always had the understand that you query APIs for data and they return it. IN the samples provided it seems like you build the data and store it in a MongoDB? 
From Me to Everyone:  06:21 PM
Thanks Aaron!
From Kyle Creek to Everyone:  06:25 PM
Yeah that makes sense
From PYTHON Host to Everyone:  06:26 PM
Does anyone have a Windows computer?
From Kyle Creek to Everyone:  06:26 PM
I have a windows computer
From PYTHON Host to Everyone:  06:27 PM
My understanding is that you were able to install Mongo, Kyle…
From Kyle Creek to Everyone:  06:27 PM
I believe so
From PYTHON Host to Everyone:  06:27 PM
:)
From Kyle Creek to Everyone:  06:27 PM
I ran the file given in the "activity" foler and it worked
From danielcastro to Everyone:  06:29 PM
You can run this script to test it
https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1260484/files/56075781?module_item_id=9450736
Yes we can see it
From Kyle Creek to Everyone:  06:32 PM
what is the significance of host and port? is that like an IP addres?
From Kyle Creek to Everyone:  06:42 PM
Its gets confusing
From PYTHON Host to Everyone:  06:42 PM
Yes.
And what else?
From danielcastro to Everyone:  06:42 PM
The length of all of them might not match?
From Kyle Creek to Everyone:  06:42 PM
Uses a lot of memory?
From Lola Guerrero to Everyone:  06:42 PM
it might never finish
From Aaron Devey to Everyone:  06:42 PM
big O gets really out of hand
From PYTHON Host to Everyone:  06:43 PM
Or at least not within reasonable time...
Say we need to browse through 1,000,000 records in one for loop, 1,000 in the second, 1,000 in the thitd,
From Aaron Devey to Everyone:  06:43 PM
exponential loops
From PYTHON Host to Everyone:  06:45 PM
And 1,000 in the fourth for loop.
The number of records retrieved does grow exponentially with number of fors.
Indexes
From Kyle Creek to Everyone:  06:47 PM
is there similiar documentation for mongo
like there is for the database stuff we used last week?
From Aaron Devey to Everyone:  06:50 PM
there should be some docs for pymongo
http://api.mongodb.com/python/current/tutorial.html
From Kyle Creek to Everyone:  06:51 PM
I think I might have misunderstood the structure. So if you would be so kind please correct me if I'm wrong. MongoDB is just the location that houses the data. The code that is written utilizes the Pymongo module to obtain and manipulate that housed data
From Aaron Devey to Everyone:  06:52 PM
MongoDB is actually a server or daemon
From PYTHON Host to Everyone:  06:52 PM
I think you are both right.
From Kyle Creek to Everyone:  06:53 PM
what is a daemon
I don't have much of a CS background so I'm trying to wrap my head around some of these conceptfs
From Aaron Devey to Everyone:  06:53 PM
there are other kinds of servers or daemons that you might already be familiar with, such as web servers
From PYTHON Host to Everyone:  06:53 PM
The point is: in real World, you would not connect to a local application, you would connect to a server, with a specified IP address. Through Python, you’d be able to insert and manipulate (query, delete, update) data.
From Aaron Devey to Everyone:  06:54 PM
when you go to a website for example, you're connecting to a web server
daemon is just another word for a server
From PYTHON Host to Everyone:  06:54 PM
The beauty of data base approach: while you are connecting to it, it I can also connect, and this is precisely when you are on FB. When you type a status, it goes to a FB database, when I am commenting on your status, it goes there, too, but from my client (browser).
From Kyle Creek to Everyone:  06:54 PM
got it. Thank you. 
From PYTHON Host to Everyone:  06:57 PM
Deamon is an application running on a server; server is typically a machine, deamon is a software.
Do you see my screen with (pdb) prompt?
From Kyle Creek to Everyone:  07:00 PM
yes
where do you define the initial databse media 
or does calling it initialize it
From Kyle Creek to Everyone:  07:22 PM
why do you have to assign the insert function to the "result" variable
From Kyle Creek to Everyone:  07:41 PM
I'm ready whenever
From rlarge to Everyone:  07:41 PM
ready
From Lola Guerrero to Everyone:  07:41 PM
mee too
From Sam Chang to Everyone:  07:41 PM
ready to go
