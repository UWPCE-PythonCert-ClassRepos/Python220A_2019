# **************************
# Title: inventory.py
# Desc:
# 1. Create a python module called inventory.py, to replace the existing spreadsheet.
# 2. Create a function called add_furniture that takes the following input parameters:
#         invoice_file
#         customer_name
#         item_code
#         item_description
#         item_monthly_price
# This function will create invoice_file (to replace the spreadsheetâ€™s data)
# if it doesnt exist, or append a new line to it if it does exist.
#
# 3. Create a function called single_customer:
#        Input parameters: customer_name, invoice_file.
#        Output: Returns a function that takes one parameter, rental_items.
# single_customer needs to use functools.partial and closures, in order to return a function
# that will iterate through rental_items and add each item to invoice_file.
#
# should write a try catch block to identify if items are not included such as if item no has more than len(4) error.
#
# Change Log: (Who, When, What)
# Justin Jameson, 20190525, created file
